# Notes for Instructor

When it comes to inputs, there are two types of them, "uncontrolled" and "controlled" inputs.

In practical terms, an uncontrolled component is one whose value is changed exclusively by the _user interacting with it_.

You can still set the initial state of an uncontrolled component with defaultValue (and defaultChecked).

A controlled component is one that does not own its state, but rather its state is controlled by the component that rendered it.

In practical terms it means the state is controlled exclusively by the _programmer_.
