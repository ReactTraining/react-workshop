# State

## Goals

Fetch vacation data when the button is clicked. Map over the data to show the results

## Task 1

The button and data-fetching code are already written. You just need to write the state. We have a generic looking call to `useState` so work with that and change the variable names to be more appropriate for vacations. The initial state could be `null` or an empty array (whatever you want) to indicate that you have not loaded data yet.

## Bonus Task

If you feel like you have time, try to implement a "Loading..." indicator so when the button is pushed you can indicate the page is loading. See the final for ideas.

## Finished When

You can see all the vacation data show up
