import * as React from 'react'

export function TaskOne() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>Get some state working with context. Use `selectedIndex` and `setSelectedIndex`.</li>
      <li>
        Create a context called `TabsContext` and pass the `selectedIndex` and `setSelectedIndex`
        down through context.
      </li>
      <li>
        We're going to need to know the index of each tab. You'll need to iterate the `children` of
        `TabList`. The children of `TabList` is `Tab`. Use `React.Children.map` to get the index and
        pass it to each Tab. You could use `React.cloneElement` but there are some drawbacks.
        Another way is to create another type of context so we can pass index down from `TabList` to
        `Tab`. Note that you'll need a different context provider than the main `TabsContext`. We
        made a context for you already called `TabListContext`
      </li>
      <li>
        For the panels, use the HTML `hidden` attribute to hide panels that are not active. Note,
        you are going to need to iterate in `TabPanels` similarly to the task above in order to pass
        down the index of each panel so it can compare itself to the selectedIndex it will get from
        context.
      </li>
      <li>Add a `data-selected` attribute to the tab that is selected.</li>
      <li>
        Add these ARIA roles to the appropriate places: `tablist`, `tab`, and `tabpanel`. Note that
        it's not `aria-role=""` it's just `role=""`.
      </li>
      <li>Add aria-selected="true" (or false) for each tab.</li>
    </ul>
  )
}

export function TaskTwo() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implement an `onChange` with the `Tabs` component so we can let the owner know when the
        index has changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement an `onClick` with the `Tab` component. Be sure to wrap with `wrapEvent`. Remember
        the whole point of this is that we have our own onClick we're passing to tab so `wrapEvent`
        will make a single onClick function from the one passed in through props and our internal
        one. This will also allow the owner to do `event.preventDefault` which will cancel our
        internal event from firing.
      </li>
    </ul>
  )
}

export function TaskThree() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>Give the option for the owner to control the index by passing an `index` prop in.</li>
      <li>
        Implement `aria-controls` (The tab controls the panel) and `aria-labelledby` (the panel is
        labeled by the tab). This requires a unique ID for all Tabs and Tab Panels. One idea is to
        make a `tabsId` and then you can use this along with the indexes of Tabs and Tab Panels to
        create a completely unique ID
      </li>
    </ul>
  )
}
