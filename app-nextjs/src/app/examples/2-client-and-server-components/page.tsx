// Two ways to try using ServerTwo
// ✅ imported above the client boundary and passed as children
// ❌ imported below the client boundary

// The reason is because server components cannot be subjected to
// prop changes from client components. If a client comp had state
// and passed it as a prop to a server comp, how would that server
// comp "re-render" when it doesn't run on the client
