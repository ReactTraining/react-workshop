# Lecture Notes

## Login Form

Demo the basics of `<Form>` and how action is HTTP verbs besides GET.

Play with the `onSubmit` area for a bit and show different React ways to collect form values

```js
// const formData = new FormData(event.target) // works, but TS complains
const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)
formData.get('username)
```

Explain `Object.fromEntries(formData)`

In the action: `formData = await request.formData()`

Refactor fields to a `<FieldWrap>`

We can talk about the utility of `useId`

Show zod in the final example for validation

## Browsing Products: Two Forms one Action

Wrap the buttons in their own `<Form>` elements and submit their data to the action. Give each an `_action` form data item to differentiate requests.

Will have to eventually do for numbers

```ts
const productId = parseInt(formData.get('productId')! as string)
```

Demo `useNavigation` and the problems with getting its status for many forms:

- Each time we add to cart, it cancels the previous navigation
- useNavigation models the page's navigation with one form, not suitable for our single button forms when we have lots of forms
- If we leave out the product id comparison, all the buttons will respond to "isSubmitting" at the same time.
- If we put the comparison in and quickly click on buttons, each new click will change the id and visually cancel the previous

```ts
const isSubmitting =
  navigation.state === 'submitting' &&
  navigation?.formData?.get('productId') === product.id.toString()
```

Refactor action to `request.method === 'POST` or `DELETE`.

## Fetcher

Abstract buttons to their own components to `useFetcher`

Use real cookie based `addToCart` and `removeFromCart`. Remember they setup the response so return the `await` (see final)

## Extra

Talk about how our action could respond with `json()` data which we could pick up with `useActionData` similarly to `useLoaderData`.

Lets say an action adds something like a new product to out list. We wouldn't have to query and return that new product from the action because after actions get called, Remix calls the loader to get any new data that may have occurred from the action's mutation of our data
