# Routes And Layouts

The goal of this practice is to make files for these routes:

```js
// URL                               SUB LAYOUT      CONTENT
// localhost:3000                    CommonLayout    "Home Page"
// localhost:3000/contact            CommonLayout    "Contact"
// localhost:3000/auth/login         AuthLayout      "Login"
// localhost:3000/auth/register      AuthLayout      "Register"
// localhost:3000/products           ProductsLayout  "Browse Products"
// localhost:3000/products/1         ProductsLayout  "Product Profile: 1"
// localhost:3000/products/special   ProductsLayout  "Special Product Profile"
```

## Task 1

We have already provided three sub-layout designs in `templates.tsx`. They are color-coded so each type of sub-layout looks different:

Gray - Common Layout
Green - AuthLayout
Blue - Product Layout

Make route files to achieve the URLs that you see at the top of this page. Each URL shows you which layout it uses. For the content of the page, just write a simple h1 heading with the page title like "Home Page" for the home page.

Remember that each of these sub-layouts will go in the MainLayout. Since the MainLayout is always used, it's being used in the root.tsx file.

Here's an example of the nesting that we're making assuming you're on a page for products:

```jsx
<MainLayout>
  <ProductLayout>
    <Page />
  </ProductLayout>
</MainLayout>
```

For example, if you visit `/products`, you should see a page loaded into the `ProductsLayout` and the page should say `<h1>Browse Products</h1>`. If you visit `/products/1` and `products/special`, these would utilize the same `ProductsLayout`.

## Final

Remember, for this and all practices, there's a `final` version for you to review if you need to with all the answers. In this case, the final is in `practice-final`.
